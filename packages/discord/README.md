# The Everdawn Discord Client

The Discord client for The Everdawn.

## Gotchas

The discord.js library seems to have a few quirks with typescript - even with code copied straight from [the guide](https://discordjs.guide). If you run into [any of these](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/6638) then unless it's a quick fix, feel free to raise an issue on their Github and stick a `// @ts-ignore` before the offending line, preferably with an explanatory comment and/or link to the Github issue if appropriate.
