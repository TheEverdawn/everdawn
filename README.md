# The Everdawn Discord App

## Getting started

- `npm install`
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (ask an admin if you don't know them)

To ensure all our code is formatted the same, make sure your editor supports/has plugins enabled for Editorconfig, Eslint and Prettier. If you're using VSCode, it should have suggested some based on the contents of our `.vscode/extensions.json` file. If not, take a look in that file for which ones to install.

## Running it

`node index.js`
